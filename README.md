# To-Do List Application

## Aim
The aim of this project is to create a fully functional To-Do List application using ES6 JavaScript. This project helps in understanding and applying various ES6 features such as classes, modules, arrow functions, template literals, and the fetch API.

## Explanation
This To-Do List application provides a user-friendly interface for managing daily tasks. The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Additionally, users can filter tasks based on their completion status. The application stores tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the data persists across page reloads.

## Features
- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task with a title, description, and due date.
- **Edit Task**: Users can edit the details of an existing task.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete a task.
- **Complete Task**: Users can mark a task as complete or incomplete.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks by their completion status (all, completed, incomplete).
- **Persist Data**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage.
- **Fetch Tasks**: Optionally, users can fetch tasks from a provided API endpoint and display them in the list.

## Code Structure
- **HTML**: Contains the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Provides the styling for the application, making it visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the functionality of the application using ES6 features.
